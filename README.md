# PennApps 2025: ShadeNav

Climate change has created a devastating feedback loop: rising temperatures make walking unbearable, forcing people to drive more, pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, making cities even hotter.

**ShadeNav breaks this cycle** by making walking comfortable again through intelligent shade-optimized routing. Using satellite analysis and real-time sun positioning, we find paths that maximize shade coverage - because shaded areas feel up to 20°F cooler than direct sunlight.

A comprehensive route-planning system for downtown Philadelphia that optimizes paths based on shade coverage and essential services using advanced satellite imagery analysis and OpenStreetMap data.

## Quickstart

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows
   # or
   source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Google Earth Engine (for satellite data):**
   ```bash
   # Install Earth Engine API
   pip install earthengine-api
   
   # Authenticate (this will open a browser window)
   python -c "import ee; ee.Authenticate()"
   
   # Test authentication
   python -c "import ee; ee.Initialize(); print('Earth Engine working!')"
   ```

4. **Optional: Configure project settings:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .example.env .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your Google Cloud Project ID (optional)
   # This is only needed if you want to use a specific project
   ```

5. **Run tree detection:**
   ```bash
   python tree_detection.py
   ```

6. **Run waypoint pathfinding:**
   ```bash
   python waypoint_pathfinding.py
   ```

7. **Start the API server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Pre-generated Data

The backend includes pre-generated JSON files from running the detection systems:

- `tree_positions.json`: 703 detected trees with satellite analysis data
- `waypoints_data.json`: Essential services waypoint data

These files can be used immediately without running the detection algorithms.

## API Integration

The generated JSON files can be easily integrated with frontend applications:

```python
import json

# Load tree data
with open('tree_positions.json', 'r') as f:
    tree_data = json.load(f)

# Access trees
trees = tree_data['trees']
for tree in trees:
    lat, lon = tree['latitude'], tree['longitude']
    density = tree['density']
    source = tree['source']
```

## Development Process

### Developing the graph
![Visualization of roads in downtown Philadelphia](figs/philly_roads.png)

Initial street network extraction from OpenStreetMap showing downtown Philadelphia's road infrastructure. This visualization demonstrates the comprehensive coverage of walkable paths that form the foundation of our routing graph.

### Processing edge shadow data
![Generating shadow profiling for edges in graph](figs/hackathon2.png)

Shadow analysis pipeline in action, processing individual street segments (edges) to calculate shade coverage. The visualization shows the computational process of analyzing building heights and sun angles to determine shadow patterns for each walkable path.

### Profiling edges at different times of day
![Morning shadow analysis](figs/hackathon3.png) ![Midday shadow coverage](figs/hackathon4.png) ![Afternoon shade patterns](figs/hackathon5.png) ![Evening shadow distribution](figs/hackathon6.png)

Temporal shadow analysis across different hours of the day, demonstrating how shade patterns shift as the sun moves. Each visualization captures shadow distribution at key times (morning, midday, afternoon, evening), showing the dynamic nature of urban shade coverage that drives our intelligent routing decisions.
